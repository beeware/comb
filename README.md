Comb
====

A repository of BeeKeeper task configurations used by the BeeWare project.

Each subdirectory of the `tasks` directory is a Docker image. These images
are automatically built and published as part of the `pybee` organization
on Docker Hub.

If your own testing needs don't match these base images, they can be used
as a template for your own Docker images, which can be referenced in the
BeeKeeper configuration file for your project.
